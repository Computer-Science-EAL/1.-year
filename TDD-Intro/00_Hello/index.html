    <h2>Some Definitions</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Unit Testing</b> refers to writing a set of functions that
        sit next to a given module of program code.  These functions run
        a series of tests that assure, more-or-less thoroughly, that the
        program code performs as it is supposed to.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, assume there is a function called <tt>add</tt> that
        takes two integers as parameters, adds them together, and
        returns their sum.  There might be one unit test that calls
        <tt>add</tt> with 2 and 3, and makes sure the result is 5.
        There might be additional unit tests that "push the envelope" in
        various other ways, testing its behavior with large numbers,
        negative numbers, illegal parameters (e.g. strings), and so
        forth.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once a full suite of unit tests is developed, it is good
        practice to run these tests as often as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Test-First Development</b> (sometimes called <b>
            Test-Driven
            Development
        </b> or <b>Test-Driven Design</b>) is the practice of
        writing the unit tests <i>first</i>, before you write a single
        line of implementation code.  While this may seem like putting
        the cart before the horse, there are several good reasons why
        you might want to do this:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            It forces you to think first about the design of the
            <i>interface</i> to the code, instead of jumping straight to the
            <i>implementation</i>.  Having a well-designed interface is
            often more important than having an efficient implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Writing tests is often seen as a chore; writing the tests
            first guarantees that at the end of the day you will have
            written a suite of unit tests (rather than leaving them until
            the end and possibly never getting around to it).
        </li>
        <li>
            If you apply a tight cycle of write one test, then write the
            code to implement that test, then write the next test, your
            code ends up growing organically.  This often (though not
            always) leads to less wasted effort; you end up writing all
            the code you need, and none of the code you don't need.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        A <b>Unit Testing Framework</b> is a tool or library that
        provides a backdrop for writing unit tests. For example, to
        implement a unit test in the popular

        <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Unit_Testing_Framework">
            MSTest framework,
        </A>

        you add a test project to a visual studio solution.
        The project will come prefilled with a test class and a test method.
        You can see this because the class and the test will be anotated with the word <tt>[TestClass]</tt> or <tt>[TestMethod]</tt>
        Every method with has this annotation is a seperate unit test.

        You then click on Test in the menu bar in visual studio and pick Run -> All Tests (Ctrl + R, A) and it loads your
        class and executes each test method in turn, monitoring the
        results and providing feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Test-First Training</b> follows the example of Test-First
        Development, but with an educational twist.  In Test-First
        Training, the student begins with a single unit test (written by
        the teacher).  In order to implement the test, the student has
        to create source code <i>from scratch</i>.  The student then
        tries to compile and run the test; if the test cannot compile,
        or if the test runs and fails, then the student must go and fix
        his error.  He then moves on to the next test in the lesson.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Test-First Training?</h2>

    <p>
        In traditional programming exercises, you are either given a
        fairly large task and asked to implement the whole thing, or you
        are provided with "skeleton code" -- source code that has been
        eviscerated to remove key sections, which you are asked to fill
        in.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Large task" exercises are often challenging to students because
        of their sheer size.  Many lines of code need to be written
        before the student receives any positive reinforcement that they
        are on the right track.  This can be frustrating to a beginning
        student, and boring to an advanced one.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Skeleton code" exercises are also frustrating.  The task of the
        student should be to figure out how to write code that will
        accomplish the given task.  With skeleton code, they are first
        presented with the task of figuring out what the original author
        was trying to do; of reading through his code (often littered
        with idiosyncratic idioms and obscure comments); and then of
        trying to implement just one part of the algorithm he chose,
        without necessarily understanding the larger picture.  If the
        fill-in-the-blank code section is too complicated, he may never
        complete the assignment; if it's too simple, he may proceed
        without having learned a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, in both types of traditional exercises, the student
        doesn't really know when he's finished!  Sometimes, he will
        succeed in the task, but neglect to print his results, and will
        keep at it, believing he's still missing something; other times,
        he will write code that seems to work but is crucially flawed in
        some way or another. This is one of the most powerful features
        of test-first development -- you code until the test passes, and
        then you stop coding.  The test provides a map to the student,
        informing him of where to begin, and where to end.
    </p>

    <p>
        Test-first training is appropriate for both local and remote
        use.  If a student is in a classroom, he may rely on his
        classmates or teachers for guidance; but if he is alone, the
        tests provide some measure of feedback and guidance (although
        unit tests can never actually debug his code).
    </p>

    <p>
        Perhaps the most important aspect of test-first training is that
        it teaches the whole process, from opening a new file in a text
        editor to compiling and running.  At the end of the day, the
        students can say, "At least I know how to write a program."
        Many exercises, especially skeletons but also those based on
        tools and toy problems, end up skipping the fundamentals that
        are vital not just for coding on a day-to-day basis, but also
        for cementing the higher-level concepts into habits and skills.
        (For a C# example, if a student is always provided with a
        skeleton <tt>main()</tt> method, he may end up never memorizing
        the cryptic but essential incantation, "<tt>
            public static void
            main(String[] args)
        </tt>").
    </p>

    <h2>How To Use These Exercises</h2>

    <p>
        The exercises are divided into modules.  Each module contains
        several tests.  For each test, you are to write all the code to
        make it run.  Let's walk through this process for a sample
        module.  (Here we assume that you've already visual studio and configured
        it for your system.)
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            On your file system, in the same directory as this file, locate the following file <tt>00_Hello.sln</tt> and double click it.
            This should open visual studio.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Now choose UnitTest1.cs from the solution explorer window.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            At the bottom of the screen you will probably see two identical error messages.
            This is because visual studio has tried to compile the unit tests for us.
            If you cannot see them, go to View -> Error List.
            <br /><br />
        </li>

        <li>
            The error messages will look
            something like this:
            <pre>
                CS0246	The type or namespace name 'Functions' could not be found
 (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)	00_Hello
	C:\Users\zzz\1.Year\00_Hello\00_Hello\UnitTest1.cs	12
	</pre>

            This is the .Net compiler telling you that you need an object
            (class) named Functions.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            So we need to create a class named Functions.
            The errors mirror the red squiggly lines in the code. So right click on one of the squiggly lines and pick <tt>Quick Actions...</tt>
            This brings up a few possible fixes to your problem. You can pick the one saying: <tt>
                Generate class for 'Functions' in '_00_Hello' (in new file)
            </tt>
            Tests and Actual code should always be kept in seperate files.

            Your new class should look like this:
            <pre>
internal class Functions
{
}
	</pre>

            This is the way you create a "stub class", or an object that
            doesn't do anything yet.

            (capitalization <b>
                is very
                important
            </b> in C#, so make sure the "F" in Functions is capitalized),
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Try to compile your solution again by clicking
            <pre>Build -> Build Solution.</pre>
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            It should fail again!  This time, the message will be
            something like:
            <pre>
               CS1061	'Functions' does not contain a definition for 'Hello' and no extension method
 'Hello' accepting a first argument of type 'Functions' could be found
 (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)	00_Hello
	C:\Users\zzz\Documents\1.Year\00_Hello\00_Hello\UnitTest1.cs	13
	</pre>

            This is typical for test-first development.  You may have to
            mess with your implementation code several times before the
            test will compile.  (This is partly because C# is a
            <b>strongly typed</b> language, and refuses to cooperate until
            it has a lot of information about the other classes in your
            world.)

            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Make Functions.cs look like this:
            <pre>
public class Functions
{
    public String Hello()
    {
        return "Goodbye";
    }
}
	</pre>
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Compile the test one more time.

            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Now run the test, using the <tt>Test Explorer</tt> Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer.
            <pre>Run all</pre>
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            This should also fail!  (Are you getting used to failure yet?)
            This is meant to simulate you not getting the answer right the
            first time.  You should see a message like:
            <pre>
Test Name:	TestHello
Test FullName:	_00_Hello.UnitTest1.TestHello
Test Source:	C:\Users\zzz\Documents\1.Year\00_Hello\00_Hello\UnitTest1.cs : line 11
Test Outcome:	Failed
Test Duration:	0:00:00,0729017
Result StackTrace:	ved _00_Hello.UnitTest1.TestHello() i C:\Users\zzz\Documents\1.Year\00_Hello\00_Hello\UnitTest1.cs:linje 13
Result Message:	Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:&lt;Hello&gt;. Actual:&lt;Goodbye&gt;.
Running FunctionsTest0
testHello...FAILURE
	</pre>
            This is the Test program telling you that it tried to run the
            test case called "TestHello" but it failed.  The test case was
            expecting to get back the string "Hello" but instead, it got
            the string "Goodbye".  To be helpful, it lists the exact
            source file and line number where the assertion was made.
            Count down the list of lines until you see the one caused
            by your specific test case.
            <pre>ved _00_Hello.UnitTest1.TestHello() i C:\Users\zzz\Documents\1.Year\00_Hello\00_Hello\UnitTest1.cs:linje 13</pre>
            Open up this file (UnitTest1.cs) and look at line 13.
            <pre>Assert.AreEqual("Hello", x.Hello());</pre>
            This gives you a big hint that the problem is somewhere inside
            the method called <tt>Hello()</tt>.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Go back to Functions.cs and fix it.
            <pre>
public class Functions
{
    public String Hello()
    {
        return "Hello";
    }
}
	</pre>
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Recompile and rerun the test. (Always be sure to recompile!)
            <pre>
	</pre>
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, for extra credit, uncomment the other test method <pre>TestHelloFred()</pre>  by removing the preceding slashes. Compile and and try to make it pass.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Still with me?  Good!  You are now ready to begin.  For each
        module, try to make each test pass, in numerical order.  Each
        module has an index.html page that gives you background on the
        programming tasks, and hints on how to complete individual
        tests.
