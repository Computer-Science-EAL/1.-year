                <h1>Notes</h1>
                <h2>StockTest*:</h2>

                <p>
                    First of all! You should complete this assignement/lab before moving on to the next
                </p>

                <p>

                    Imagine you're writing a stock trading program.  The most important
                    feature is to get a list of the user's current stock portfolio, and to
                    calculate its value.  So we start off writing an object that
                    encapsulates a single stock, with fields (also known as variables,
                    properties, or members) for symbol, price per share, and number of
                    shares.  We also want a method that computes the dollar value per
                    stock (price per share x number of shares).
                </p>

                <p>

                    Use variables of type <tt>double</tt> for price and value.
                </p>


                <p>

                    <h3>Notes on individual tests:</h3>

                    <b>CanSetAndGetSymbol, CanSetAndGetPrice, CanSetAndGetNumShares</b>: write a straightforward
                    property for these three properties.
                </p>

                <p>

                    <b>CanSetAndGetNumShares</b> also requires a calculator method, <b>GetValue</b>,
                    that computes the value of the stock by multiplying the price by the number
                    of shares.
                </p>

                <p>

                    <b>CanUseMultiArgumentConstructor</b>: a constructor is called when an object
                    is first created (instantiated).  This is usually a good place to set
                    the initial values of all properties.  Note that if you don't specify
                    any constructor, the compiler always adds an implicit default
                    constructor (one that takes no arguments); this means that if you
                    <b>add</b> a non-default constructor, you will have to <b>also</b> add
                    a default constructor if you want the old tests to work.  This can be
                    done with a simple
<pre>public Stock() { }</pre>
                </p>

                <p>

                    <b>CanCalculateTotalValue</b>: This test calls a <b>static</b> method called
                    <tt>TotalValue</tt> that takes an <b>array of Stocks</b> as a
                    parameter.  A static method is attached to the object class itself,
                    but not to any specific instance of that object.  The declaration for
                    the <tt>TotalValue</tt> method should be something like
<pre>public static double TotalValue(Stock[] stocks)</pre>
                </p>

                <p>

                    <b>CanCreateToString</b>: Every C# object has a method called ToString.
                    It returns a string representing that object and its values.  ToString
                    is supposed to be used for debugging, not for showing to an end-user,
                    so its output does not have to be pretty.  However, the default
                    implementation of ToString is <b>really</b> not pretty, so most people
                    <b>override</b> ToString and write their own.  The CanCreateToString method
                    asks you to implement ToString following the standard idiom of
                    printing the name of the class, then its properties surrounded by [
                    square brackets ].
                </p>

                <p>

                    (When you call <tt>System.Console.Write(foo)</tt>, the <tt>Write</tt>
                    method actually invokes foo's <tt>ToString</tt> method and prints that
                    value.)
                </p>

                <p>

                    <b>TwoStockObjectsWithSameValuesAreEqual</b>: C# has two main concepts of equality.  The first
                    is, "Are these two object references literally the same instance?"
                    That is embodied by the <tt>Equals</tt> method.  The second is, "Are the
                    <b>contents</b> of these two objects the same?"  That is emodied by
                    the == operator.  This test assures that two separate
                    objects, created with the same values, are truly counted as equal.
                    There are however ways to test the content of two objects by still using the Equals method
                </p>

                <p>

                    <b>TwoStockObjectsWithDifferentValuesAreNotEqual</b>: This debugs your equals method, making sure that
                    you are comparing all values and so forth.
                </p>


                <h2>PolymorphismTest*:</h2>

                <p>
                    Polymorphism is the object-oriented property whereby two objects of
                    different classes can be treated identically, at least to a certain
                    extent.  Polymorphism is implemented in C# in two ways:
                    <b>inheritance</b> and <b>interfaces</b>.  To implement these tests,
                    you must first create an interface called
                    <tt>Asset</tt>, then make your Stock object <b>implement</b>
                    the Asset parent.  The only thing an Asset
                    needs to do, for present purposes, is return its value, so Asset
                    will only need a <tt>GetValue</tt> method.
                </p>
                <p>

                    You will then create another type of asset, a Savings Account.
                    Then you will see how useful polymorphism is -- it
                    allows you to (very slightly) change your TotalValue method so it
                    works on any type of asset, not just stocks.
                </p>
                <p>

                    (From an object-oriented design point of view, this new TotalValue
                    method will be slightly out-of-place.  It's still in the Stock class,
                    but is not restricted to Stocks.  We are about to clean this up by
                    making a new object, Portfolio, that is devoted to holding collections
                    of assets.)

                </p>

                <h2>PortfolioTest*:</h2>

                Finally, we will make a Portfolio object, responsible for holding a
                group of assets.  Here let's not worry too much about making this
                object robust -- we will do that later, in the Collections lab.  For
                now, just make sure it will work for a collection of a few
                assets.
