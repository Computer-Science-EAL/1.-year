    <h1>Bonus: Refactoring Lesson</h1>

    <p>
        While we were creating the Stock and Portfolio objects
        test-first, we needed a totalValue method.  For simplicity's
        sake, we put it inside the Stock class.  But now that we have a
        Portfolio object, we see that <tt>Stock.TotalValue</tt> is not
        useful any more.  Furthermore, the code inside
        <tt>Stock.TotalValue</tt> is nearly identical to the code inside
        <tt>Portfolio.GetTotalValue</tt>.  There is a simple three-stage
        refactoring that will remove this redundancy and leave us with
        cleaner code that is easier to understand, maintain, and
        improve.

    <h2>Step 1: Move method</h2>
    <p>
        Move the method TotalValue from Stock.cs to Portfolio.cs.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will make Portfolio.cs look something like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
...
    public double GetTotalValue()
    {
        double total = 0;
        for (int i=0; i&lt;c; ++i)
        {
            total += assets[i].GetValue();
        }
        return total;
    }
    public static double TotalValue(Asset[] assets)
    {
        double total = 0;
        for (int i=0; i&lt;c; ++i)
        {
            total += assets[i].GetValue();
        }
        return total;
    }
...
    </pre>
    <p>
        If you are not using a Refactoring Tool 
        then you will have to manually go through your source code, find
        all references to <tt>Stock.TotalValue()</tt>, and change them
        to call <tt>Portfolio.TotalValue</tt> instead.  (Yes, this means
        changing it in tests as well.  (A Refactoring Tool will take
        care of this sort of tedious change for you.)  Once you've made
        this change, recompile and run all tests.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Merge Methods</h2>
    <p>
        Notice that the contents of the two methods are nearly
        identical.  We can define one in terms of the other, unifying
        them as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
    public static double TotalValue(Asset[] assets)
    {
        return new Portfolio(assets).GetTotalValue();
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
        While this may seem slightly less efficient (we need to create a
        new Portfolio object each time), this will only become visible
        if this method happens to be called inside a critical loop.
    </p>
    <p>
        After you make the change, compile and re-run all the tests to
        make sure the two methods really were equivalent.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Inline method (optional)</h2>
    <p>
        The static TotalValue method is now almost useless.  If you
        like, you can make it go away entirely by replacing every call
        to
    </p>
<pre>Portfolio.TotalValue(x)</pre>
    <p>
        with
    </p>
<pre>new Portfolio(x).GetTotalValue()</pre>
    <p>
        elsewhere in your code.  Once you have done that for all
        callers, you may delete the static TotalValue method altogether.
        Then do a clean recompile (to make sure you caught all the
        references).
    </p>
