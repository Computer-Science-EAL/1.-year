# Learn_C-Sharp
The idea with this repository is to teach people C# through Test driven development.

This should actually have been a fork of https://github.com/ultrasaurus/test-first-teaching but instead it is simply a copy of the concept. Many thanks to the authors of the concept:  [Sarah Allen](http://ultrasaurus.com/) and [Alex Chaffee](http://alexch.github.com/)

In order to follow the course you should download/clone the repository. The repository consists of a number of unit tests grouped by theme and written in C#. It is now your job to write the necessary code to make them pass. Once you advance, only the name of the unit test will be provided.
